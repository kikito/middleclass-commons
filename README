== middleclass-commons

This is a small middleclass plug-in that makes it possible to use middleclass with Class-Commons (https://github.com/bartbes/Class-Commons)

In order to make middleclass compliant with Class-Common's specs, you must download and install middleclass-commons right after you do the same with middleclass:


    require 'middleclass'
    require 'middleclass-commons'


And then you are good to go.

== tests

The tests are stored on a git submodule. Use the following commands to get them

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Then launch the tests like this:

    lua tests/tests.lua middleclass_test

That should do it.
